# History Feature Documentation

## Overview
The History feature allows users to track, view, and manage their previously generated question sets. Each user has their own separate history stored in the browser's localStorage.

## Features Added

### 1. **History Component** (`History.jsx` & `History.css`)
- Displays a list of all previously generated question sets
- Shows set name, timestamp, and question count breakdown
- Allows users to load previous sets
- Allows users to delete history items
- Responsive design with smooth animations

### 2. **User-Specific Storage**
- Each user's history is stored separately in localStorage
- Storage key format: `questionHistory_${username}`
- Persists between sessions
- Automatically clears when user logs out

### 3. **History Management Functions**

#### Save to History
When a user generates a new question set, it automatically saves:
- Set name (fileName)
- All 75 questions with their details
- Generation timestamp
- Unique ID for each history item

#### Load from History
Users can click "Load" on any history item to:
- Restore the exact question set
- View all questions as they were generated
- Download or print the set

#### Delete History
Users can delete individual history items:
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Removes from both state and localStorage
- Permanent deletion (cannot be undone)

### 4. **UI Updates**

#### Header
- New "üìö History" button appears when user is logged in
- Positioned next to the username dropdown
